# Simple intel 8080 assembly interpreter
A simple interpreter for intel 8080 assembly written in javascript using React.js.
This is meant as an education tool for learning assembly language. Intel 8080 had a very small amount of instructions and features making it easier for people to understand basics of assembly

## Notes
* ### Programs can modify themselves
    Because both program code and memory share same space, code can modify itself
* ### This is meant as a remake/rebuild of a tool i had to use in university
    This project is meant as replacement for tool that i had to use in university, which is why it has odd functionality like ability to edit any cell or register at any time. 
    Original tool was written in borland pascal  for windows 98. *i had to use that tool 2021 :`)*
* ### Some instructions are missing
    In/Out and interruption instructions are missing because i chose them to be unnecessary for what this tool is meant to be. They may get added later
